# dotfiles

Dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Install

Just run:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaell-lycan/dotfiles/master/bootstrap | sh
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in .dotfiles to your home directory.

Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
